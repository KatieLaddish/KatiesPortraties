			<h2>My job is to paint your pets. You send me a picture of your pet that you want me to paint and I paint it for you.</h2>
		<p>I love my pets, Roscoe and Lucy. They are both dogs, and they mean so much to me. The reason I decided to make this buisness was because I just love to paint and have painting of my dogs for good memories and when you have a painting of your pet it's a lot more personal.</p>
